# Muse protocol overview

**Description:** Muse is an encrypted content and sharing management protocol that gives you all the convenience of the cloud with none of the privacy concerns.

**How it works:** From the consumer's perspective, Muse is almost entirely behind-the-scenes. A protocol implementation service runs in the background on their device, and applications connect to it. They log in once to the service, and that's it -- no more remembering countless usernames and passwords. From there, they have full control of what data goes online and who they share it with.

Everything that happens on a Muse network is encrypted from person to person (or business, or smart thermostat, etc) using an open, published specification built on industry-standard cryptography. Between them, data is algorithmically protected from outside observers: if you haven't explicitly shared something with someone, they shouldn't be able to see it. Muse doesn't protect your privacy with promises, it protects you with math.

Unlike traditional web applications, Muse apps can always be accessed offline (though some functionality may be unavailable). Not just that, depending on the implementation service, they can switch seamlessly between local networks and the internet, enabling fine-grained control over data dissemination.

Muse's first application, a private email service called Ethyr, will be hitting Kickstarter soon. More details are available at [https://ethyr.net](https://www.ethyr.net).
